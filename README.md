# masters_thesis_spotify
My repository for working on my masters thesis


The .gitignore file was created to exclude the JSON files which are very big and thus not able to be pushed to github. 
The files will generally be the scripts, EDA and ML programming that i have made, so it is possible to see what methods i have used.
